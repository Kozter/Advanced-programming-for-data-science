    "### Functional programming:\n",
    "Functional programming languages treat tasks to be accomplished in terms of mathematical functions. It helps in making the complex task explicitly simple. For example, we can define the function f(x)  =  2x + 5. This function f(x) transform any given argument like say, 7, into 19. So in functional programming, for every input, we think of a corresponding output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three best practices in functional programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function should accept at least one argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- functions should return data, or another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid the use of loop\n",
    "\n",
    "In a functional programming language, in addition to the language's built-in fundamental functions, new functions can be defined by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, data is treated as immutable in functional programming, meaning that if we want to change it, we return a new version of the data instead of the original. The same value is returned for the same argument by functions, who behave as though it is their first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the advanatges of functional programming is the ease in debugging our program and the reusability of the code."
